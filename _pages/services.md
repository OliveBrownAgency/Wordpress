			<h2>Our Process</h2>		
		<p>Built on Industry Leading Open-Source Technology</p>		
			<h2>Analysis</h2>		
		<p>First, we take the time to get to know you, what makes your business unique, who your customers and target audiences are and who your competitors are. We seek to understand what your needs are and what would make a meaningful impact for your business.</p>		
			<h2>Define</h2>		
		<p>Our  creative process starts with a research phase, where we aim to understand your company, products, services and target audience. From there, we <strong>define</strong> your businesses digital strategy.</p>		
			<h3>Design</h3>		
		<p>How will  the website look? In this step, a website wireframe is created with basic web page elements such as the header, navigation, widgets, etc. Finally, use the <strong>Design step</strong> to finalize the overall look of the website with the client and discuss decisions for colors, typography, and imagery. </p>		
			<h2>Deploy</h2>		
		<p>In the <strong>Deploy stage</strong> of the website design process is translated to actual code that makes the website work. This stage can be the most lengthy, so we keep clients informed on the status of the project.</p>		
			<h2>Testing</h2>		
		<p>The purpose of the <b>testing phase</b> is to verify that every page looks great and works correctly. We thoroughly test each page of the website, checking it's structure, content, &amp; functionality, to ensure there are no errors or bugs.</p>		
			<h2>Maintenance</h2>		
		<p>This last and final step of web design is often overlooked but <strong>website maintenance</strong> is important for the long-term health and success of a website. Just like owning a car or house, a website will need upkeep and maintenance.</p>		
			<h3>FAQ</h3>		
			<h5>Most frequent questions and answers</h5>		
												<a href="">How long does a new website take to build ?</a>
					<p>Website development length depends on a number of factors, including site complexity, review time, communication, sourcing of imagery, and more. Generally, our websites take anywhere from 2 to 6 months, with longer build times occuring due to delays in communication or client-supplied information, such as photos. Generally speaking, our team can move as fast as yours.</p>
												<a href="">Can you make edits to my existing, non-WordPress site ?</a>
					<p>We typically refrain from editing non-WordPress websites, because while we have the expertise to do so, working on websites built in other content management systems typically results in a high-budget project. Completing even simple tasks on a non-WordPress site can be time-consuming and costly, whereas we can more efficiently deliver results with a WordPress site. If needed, we can make basic edits to a non-WordPress site, but it is oftentimes more affordable to build a new WordPress website than to keep an older one on life support.</p>
												<a href="">What will I need to provide you with in order to develop a new site  ?</a>
					<p>You know your company and industry better than anyone, so we often refer to you for assistance in guiding our page copy, sourcing proper images, and more.</p>
												<a href="">Will you continue to update my site after it is built ?</a>
					<p>We offer website maintenance and hosting services. If you opt to retain us for web hosting, then we will continue to update the site and ensure that it is secure after it is built and launched. We also offer ongoing marketing services, if you wish for us to continue to add to and grow your site’s content.</p>
