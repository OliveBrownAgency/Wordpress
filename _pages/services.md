			<h1>Our Process</h1>		
		<p>Built on Industry Leading Technology</p>		
			<h2>Analysis</h2>		
		<p>First, we take the time to get to know you, what makes your business unique, who your customers and target audiences are and who your competitors are. We seek to understand what your needs are and what would make a meaningful impact for your business.</p>		
			<h2>Define</h2>		
		<p>Our  creative process starts with a research phase, where we aim to understand your company, products, services and target audience. From there, we <strong>define</strong> your businesses digital strategy.</p>		
			<h2>Design</h2>		
		<p>How will  the website look? In this step, a website wireframe is created with basic web page elements such as the header, navigation, widgets, etc. Finally, use the <strong>Design step</strong> to finalize the overall look of the website with the client and discuss decisions for colors, typography, and imagery. </p>		
			<h2>Deploy</h2>		
		<p>In the <strong>Deploy stage</strong> of the website design process is translated to actual code that makes the website work. This stage can be the most lengthy, so we keep clients informed on the status of the project.</p>		
			<h2>Testing</h2>		
		<p>The purpose of the <b>testing phase</b> is to verify that every page looks great and works correctly. We thoroughly test each page of the website, checking it's structure, content, &amp; functionality, to ensure there are no errors or bugs.</p>		
			<h2>Maintenance</h2>		
		<p>This last and final step of web design is often overlooked but <strong>website maintenance</strong> is important for the long-term health and success of a website. Just like owning a car or house, a website will need upkeep and maintenance.</p>
