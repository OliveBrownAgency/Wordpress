						Requirements					</h3>
						Website requirements are a list of necessary functions, capabilities, or characteristics related to your website and the plans for creating it.

									<h3>
						Wireframes					</h3>
						A wireframe is similar to a blueprint for your website. It maps out certain features of your site, such as menus, buttons, and layouts, while stripping away extra visual elements. This gives you an idea of your siteâ€™s underlying functionality and navigation, without distracting elements such as its color scheme and content.					
					<a>
						Clickable Button					</a>
									<h3>
						Content					</h3>
						We will gather all visual elements (including text and media) that will be presented on the site. In order to be as efficient as possible we like to let your content drive the design and layout, this not only increases production but it also optimizes information for your users and lets your designs support the content, not the other way around.
